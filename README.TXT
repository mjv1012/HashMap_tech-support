TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a technical support system for customers of the 
DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.


Q24: HashMap is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The purpose of the Hashmap is to store data values.
Q25: There are methods like put and get. And yes, you can use the same type for both its parameters.
Q26: To check how many entries are contained in a map you need to use the size() method.
Q28: The new value replaces the old value for that key.
Q29: Both entries are stored seperatly.  
Q31: It will return as null.
Q32: map.keySet()
Q34: The difference between ArrayList and HashSet is that a HashSet avoids duplicates whereas ArrayList allows for there to be duplicates. The similarities are that both of them hold objects and they're part of the Java Collections Framework.
Q35: HashSet shows only different words in any order, where ArrayList shows all words in order.
Q36: It might create empty spaces b ut it doesn't really cause many problems.
